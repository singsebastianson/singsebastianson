- 👋 Hi, I’m @singsebastianson
- 👀 I’m interested in writing stories and music for film, tv, and video games!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and some Java, since I write stories using Twine (Sugarcube).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on existing small projects with small, passionate teams who are looking for a story editor/main writer. 
- 📫 How to reach me email me singsebastianson@gmail.com or follow me @singsebastianson on Instagram. I'm also on Spotify, if you're interested!
